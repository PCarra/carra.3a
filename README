RUN PROG USING: ./runsim [-t n] [numproc] < testing.data
INCOMPLETE: I think I completed all the requirements for this project however project 2 was not graded so I'm hoping what this was based off was correct?
COMMENTS: Compared to the first two projects I felt this one went well there was plenty of time to complete and the extent of the requirements was not excessive
